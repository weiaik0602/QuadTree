# QuadTree
This project is to implement Quadtree algorith in C.
The functions will scan each quadrants by using recursive technique, it will calculate the distance between the node and the other node, it will display it out if the distance is too close.
For more details about this algorithm, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).
